## Reflection 1

Java springboot(MVC) template urges me to be more adhere to coding standards. Springboot makes each part of the program completely apart, that makes the component of the program to be built and modified independently. This relates to coding principles to ensure maintainability and readability of the codebase.

In the code, I implemented a standard naming conventions to make the code more readable. I also implement a secure coding practice by using UUID for the product id. At last, I also make a git branch for each feature as an implementation of separation of concern.

## Reflection 2

1. Well, for the time being, I feel the unit test is already sufficient. I think the amount of unit tests in a class can be a lot. That is because we have to make a test for positive and negative scenario for each feature. Although code coverage does give a percentage of measure of whether the code contains bugs, 100% code coverage still doesn't ensure that there is no bug in the code.

2. Well although I think the code will still be clean and doesn't reduce its quality, it is redundant to create the new test because the test can be incorporated in the previous test.
